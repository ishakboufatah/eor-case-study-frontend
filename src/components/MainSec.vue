                        The Acheson D3A pool is a light-medium oil carbonate reservoir at a depth of 1,547 m. The oil
                        gravity is 37.8°API.
                        The average porosity is 0.1, the average pay thickness is 18.4 m, the average water saturation
                        is 0.12 and the
                        initial reservoir pressure is 11,922 kPa. The average permeability is 2,870 mD, and the OOIP in
                        the pool was
                        9.692 x 106 m3.<br>
                        The pool location, wells and recovery performance during the miscible flood scheme are

                        This project consists of 5 active producing oil wells, 2 non-active producing oil wells, 2 water
                        disposal injection wells, 78 abandoned wells and 8 suspended oil wells. The current producing
                        rate is approximately
                        20 m3 /d oil and 145 m3 /d water, with an average water cut of 86.2 percent. In the last two
                        years, the GOR has
                        fluctuated between 100 and 140 m3 /m3 . In July 1987, a tertiary hydrocarbon miscible flood
                        scheme was initiated
                        in the northern part of the pool (current Area 2 Township 53 within approval 10003). The
                        miscible flooding was
                        further expanded to the center area of Township 52. The last continuous solvent injection
                        occurred in November 1996.
                        The total solvent injected was 1,034,762 x 103 m3 . Chase gas started in September 1988 in the
                        northern part, which
                        was highly injected (with more than 70 percent of the total gas injected), followed by the
                        southern area in January 1993.
                        The injection of chase gas ended in June 2005. Cumulative gas injection was 1,432,521 x 103 m3.
                        The estimated primary
                        recovery factor for the pool was 54 percent. The incremental EOR recovery factor with the
                        solvent/chase gas injection
                        was 18.5 percent. The remaining OIP is 1.454 x 106 m3 , and possible future incremental recovery
                        is 0.0291 x 106 m3 .<br> - <u>Reservoir Pressure :</u><br>
                        In terms of pressure maintenance, public records do have historical pressure data on some
                        wells in this approval. Public records list the initial pressure of the Acheson D-3A pool when
                        the pool was discovered in 1950 to be 11,922 kPa. The most recent pressure indicates the
                        reservoir pressure was between 10,000 and 12,000 kPa in 1998.<br>
                        This leads to the conclusion that water and solvent injection provided reasonable pressure
                        support. In terms of pressure maintenance, GeoSCOUT records the last static reservoir
                        pressure for this area for two wells on February and June 2010. Well 00/03-02-053-26W4/0
                        had a pressure of 11,101 kPag after 259 hours of shut-in and well 00/14-02-053-26W4/0
                        had a pressure of 9,844 kPag after 332 hours of shut-in. Figure 8 shows a reservoir
                        pressure distribution map as of January, 2011.<br>
                        The future depletion strategy is to maintain production as it is until the producing wells are
                        no longer economic.<br>
                        - <u>Voidage Replacement Ratio (Instantaneous and Cumulative)</u> <br>
                        Calculations were done using PVT data from well 06-23, pressure history, production
                        history, rock properties (porosity and compressibility) and the application of an aquifer
                        function, which Penn West strongly believes is partially supplying energy to the pool (as
                        mentioned in the main application); otherwise, it would be difficult to match the actual data
                        to the simulated data. In the subject area, there are two disposal wells injecting in the D-3A
                        formation which Penn West had considered when balancing the material balance equation
                        regarding fluids injected into the formation. During pressure history matching, some
                        pressure points were below those pressure data in time where the miscible flooding started,
                        and it was quite difficult to get a better match without affecting other variables. As seen in
                        the PVT analysis, the IRP and the bubble point pressure are close enough to deduce that in
                        Part 2 of the pool, some wells could be below the bubble point after production started. The
                        matching in terms of OOIP and production index was adequate.

                        The Ante Creek Beaverhill Lake pool is a light-medium oil carbonate reservoir at a depth of
                        3,433.1 m which was discovered in 1962. The oil gravity is 44°API. The average porosity is
                        0.1, the average permeability is 20 mD, the average water saturation is 0.27 and the initial
                        reservoir pressure is 35,550 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 6.218 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        Solvent flooding was started in 1968, and gas injection began in 1985. The EOR project
                        assessment is shown in Table 2. The pool location, wells and recovery performance during
                        the miscible flood scheme are summarized in Figures 3 and 4.<br>

                        The solvent flood resulted in improved oil recovery, as seen in Figure 4. Following
                        injection, the oil rate remained relatively constant at about 250 m 3 /d, until 1986, at which
                        point the production started to decline. Solvent flooding was completed in 1989, and gas
                        injection ended in 1991.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 16 percent. The remaining OIP is
                        3.855 x 10 6 m 3 .

                        There are six wells in the pool (Figure 5). Production started in 1978, and in 1980, the well
                        13-09-52-08W5 was converted to solvent injection with an injection rate of about
                        300,000 m 3 /d. Water injection into 08-08-52-08W5 was started in 1998, and solvent
                        injection was terminated in 2002. A total of about 450 x 10 6 sm 3 of solvent was injected.
                        The performance of the pool is shown in Figure 6. The oil rate fluctuated between 100 and
                        200 m 3 /d until 1994, when it started declining. The GOR had been rising steadily and by
                        1994 had reached 300 m 3 /m 3 from the original solution GOR of 40 m 3 /m 3 . The GOR peaked
                        at 4,000 m 3 /m 3 and then dropped, presumably as a result of the water injection. Figure 12
                        shows the solvent injection rate and the gas production rate plotted against time. Until
                        1994, the injection rate was significantly above the production rate. The two then tracked
                        each other until the injection rate was reduced and then stopped, when the production rate
                        exceeded the injection rate. In 2004, the gas production rate dropped dramatically. Well 13-
                        09-52-08W5 was later converted to gas production.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 31 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 18 percent. The remaining OIP is
                        0.498 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The composition of the solvent has not been found. Nevertheless, the long period with a
                        near constant GOR and the high recovery argue for miscible conditions to have been
                        achieved.

                        The Bigoray Nisku F pool is a light-medium oil carbonate reservoir at a depth of 2,404 m.
                        The oil gravity is 38.1°API. The average porosity is 0.11, the average permeability is

                        Following injection, the oil rate increased from about 300 m 3 /d in 1987 to about 600 m 3 /d in
                        1993, at which point the production started to decline. This increase in production is likely
                        partially due to the additional well that was brought on during that time period. Solvent
                        flooding was completed in 1989, and gas injection was terminated in 1995.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 40 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 23.5 percent.

                        The Brazeau River Nisku A pool is a light-medium oil carbonate reservoir at a depth of
                        3,110.3 m. The oil gravity is 44.06°API. The average porosity is 0.11, the average
                        permeability is 769 mD, the average water saturation is 0.10 and the initial reservoir
                        pressure is 45,803 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 5.3 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The pool was discovered in 1978 and placed on primary production with three wells. When
                        the reservoir pressure was close to the bubble point of 21,000 kPa in 1980, the pool was
                        converted to a miscible flood. The northernmost and structurally highest well, 05-06-49-
                        12W5M, was converted to injection with perforations close to the top of the formation. The
                        two producing wells, 11-31-48-12W5M and 15-31-48-12W5M, were perforated near the
                        base of the reservoir, about 50 m lower than the perforations in the injector. The gas
                        injection was first used to re-pressure the reservoir to 1,000-1,500 kPa above the minimum
                        miscibility pressure of 34,500 kPa, and then the pressure was kept roughly constant. The oil
                        production rate rose to about 1,200 m 3 /d and was limited mainly by facility constraints.
                        After seven years of injection, gas breakthrough occurred when the gas-oil contact was
                        estimated to be 20 m above the top of the producing perforations. In 1991, a horizontal well
                        was drilled in the reef, and it produced until 2006. Production continued with gas injection
                        until the GOR became excessive in 1994. At that time, gas injection was stopped and the
                        pool was operated in a blow-down mode. By 2012, the oil rate had dropped to about
                        10 m 3 /d with a water cut between 10 and 50 percent and a gas-oil ratio between 3,000 and
                        20,000 m 3 /m 3 .<br>

                        In order to maintain miscibility, the injected gas had to have a composition with an ethane-
                        plus component of over 10 mole percent. The actual injected gas had an ethane-plus
                        component of 12-15 mole percent.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 40.5 percent, though the conversion
                        to a miscible flood occurred when the recovery was only 6 percent of OOIP. The incremental
                        EOR recovery factor with the solvent injection was 26.5 percent, for a total recovery factor
                        of 77 percent. By the end of January, the pool had produced 4,321,439 m 3 of oil and
                        condensate, implying an actual recovery factor of 81.5 percent of OOIP.

                        The Brazeau River Nisku D pool is a light-medium oil carbonate reservoir at a depth of
                        3,069 m. The oil gravity is 42.12°API. The average porosity is 0.065, the average
                        permeability is 50 mD, the average water saturation is 0.12 and the initial reservoir
                        pressure is 34,568 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 2.7 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The pool was discovered in 1978. It was operated in a very similar manner to the Nisku A
                        pool, except that under primary, the pressure dropped to below the bubble point pressure of
                        20,480 kPa from the initial pressure of 34,500 kPa. The miscible flood was implemented and
                        the pressure raised and then kept above the minimum miscibility pressure of 35,000 kPa.
                        Gas breakthrough was much faster than in the Nisku A pool, occurring about six months
                        after the start of injection, when the gas-oil contact was estimated to be 40 m above the
                        top of the producing perforations. The early breakthrough was attributed to the poorer
                        reservoir quality in this pool by Lee, Astete and Jerhoff (1994). A horizontal well was added
                        to the pool in 1993 and was successful in increasing the oil rate and decreasing the gas-oil
                        ratio.<br>
                        The pool location, wells and recovery performance during the miscible flood scheme are
                        summarized in Figures 17 and 18. The EOR project assessment is shown in Table 6.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 50 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 15 percent.

                        The Brazeau River Nisku E pool is a light-medium oil carbonate reservoir at depth of
                        3,199.9 m. The oil gravity is 45.69°API. The average porosity is 0.10, the average water
                        saturation is 0.12 and the initial reservoir pressure is 46,019 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was
                        2.45 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The pool was also discovered in 1978. It was operated in a very similar manner to the Nisku
                        A pool, except that the production wells were perforated about 10 m above the oil-water
                        contact, since there was a water leg in this pool. The pressure dropped to close to the
                        bubble point pressure of 33,990 kPa from the initial pressure of 46,200 kPa. The miscible
                        flood was implemented and the pressure raised and then kept above the minimum
                        miscibility pressure of 37,700 kPa. Gas breakthrough occurred later than expected, in seven
                        years, when the gas-oil contact was estimated to be only 15 m above the top of the
                        producing perforations.<br>
                        The pool location, wells and recovery performance during the miscible flood scheme are
                        summarized in Figures 19 and 20. The EOR project assessment is shown in Table 7.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 45.1 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 35 percent. At the end of 2010, the
                        remaining OIP is 0.390 x 10 6 m 3 .

                        The Caroline Cardium E pool is a light-medium oil sandstone reservoir at depth of
                        2,413.6 m. The oil gravity is 46.09°API. The average porosity is 0.12, the average
                        permeability is 41.41 mD, the average water saturation is 0.16 and the initial reservoir
                        pressure is 27,614 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 4.7 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        Gas injection started in 1978, followed by water injection in 1982 and, finally, solvent
                        flooding in 1986. The EOR project assessment is shown in Table 8. The pool location, wells
                        and recovery performance during the miscible flood scheme are summarized in Figures 21
                        and 22.<br>
                        The scheme resulted in improved oil recovery, as seen in Figure 22. From the start of gas
                        injection, the oil rate increased from about 200 m 3 /d in 1978 to about 500 m 3 /d by 1989.
                        This increase in production is likely partially due to additional wells coming on production
                        over that time period. Gas injection was completed in 1986, and solvent flooding was
                        terminated in 1997.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 9 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 5 percent. The remaining OIP is
                        3.29 x 10 6 m 3 .

                        The Chigwell Viking E pool is a light-medium oil sandstone reservoir at a depth of
                        1,385.6 m. The oil gravity is 38°API. The average porosity is 0.13, the average permeability
                        is 72.89 mD, the average water saturation is 0.38 and the initial reservoir pressure is
                        9,916 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 4.986 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The Chigwell Viking E pool has been on a CO 2 flooding scheme since 2007. Since the start of
                        injection, the oil production rate has increased from about 10 m 3 /d to 100 m 3 /d. It is too
                        early to gauge the full benefits of the CO 2 flooding scheme, but the results are positive thus
                        far.<br>
                        The EOR Project Assessment of Viking E is summarized in Table 9. The pool location, wells
                        and recovery performance during the miscible flood scheme are summarized in Figures 23
                        and 24.<br>
                        The pool pressure is much lower than the expected value for its depth of 1,385.6 m. The
                        normal pressure gradient is about 10 kPa/m. With this gradient, the initial pressure should
                        be about 13,800 kPa. Clearly the reservoir is severely under-pressured. This has important
                        implications. Firstly, the reservoir can be pressured to a much higher pressure. The normal
                        fracture gradient is 18 kPa/m, so the maximum pressure is 25,000 kPa. Secondly, CO 2 may
                        not be miscible with the oil at the original reservoir pressure, but it may become miscible if
                        the reservoir pressure is increased. This seems to be the case in the Chigwell Viking I pool
                        as well.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 8 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 3 percent. The remaining OIP is
                        4.437 x 10 6 m 3 .

                        The Chigwell Viking I pool is a light-medium oil sandstone reservoir at a depth of 1,411 m.
                        The oil gravity is 38.6°API. The average porosity is 0.13, the average permeability is
                        43.76 mD, the average water saturation is 0.39 and the initial reservoir pressure is
                        7,372 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 2.075 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        Solvent flooding with Ethane was started in 1999. The scheme was followed with a miscible
                        CO 2 flood started in 2006, which is still in operation at the time of writing. The EOR project
                        assessment is shown in Table 10.<br>
                        The pool location, wells and recovery performance during the miscible flood scheme are
                        summarized in Figures 25 and 26.<br>
                        The pool pressure is much lower than the expected value for its depth of 1,411 m. The
                        normal pressure gradient is about 10 kPa/m. With this gradient, the initial pressure should
                        be about 14,100 kPa. The reservoir is severely under-pressured, which has important
                        implications. Firstly, the reservoir can be pressured to a much higher pressure. The normal
                        fracture gradient is 18 kPa/m, so the maximum pressure is 25,000 kPa.<br>
                        The minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) for CO 2 as determined in lab tests is 13,800 kPa.
                        Pressure surveys from 1997 and 2010 indicate a reservoir pressure above the MMP during
                        the solvent injection periods. The maximum pressure reached is about 16,500 kPa.<br>
                        A bubble map showing cumulative oil recovery in the Chigwell Viking I pool is given in
                        Figure 27.<br>
                        The solvent-CO 2 floods resulted in improved oil recovery, as indicated in Figures 28 and 29
                        At the start of ethane injection, the oil rate went from about 20 m 3 /d to 140 m 3 /d. After
                        the
                        start of CO 2 injection, the oil rate went from about 20 m 3 /d to 90 m 3 /d. In both cases, the
                        peak rate was immediately followed by a sharp decline, with a similar decline rate to the
                        earlier primary production (Figure 28).<br>
                        The ethane and CO 2 flood pressure history measurements are plotted in Figure 30. A plot
                        showing the daily production performance and well count can be found in Figure 31, while
                        the 6-33 WAG injection history is given in Figure 32. Finally, the net CO 2 volumes injected
                        into the pool are given in Figure 33.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 8 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent-CO 2 injection was 8 percent. The remaining OIP is
                        1.66 x 10 6 m 3 . From the production data, the primary recovery was about 240,000 m 3 , the
                        recovery due to ethane injection was 10,000 m 3 and the recovery due to CO 2 flooding to
                        date was 80,000 m 3 . This implies recovery factors of 7.2 percent for primary, 4.6 percent
                        for ethane and 3.9 percent for CO 2 , for a combined incremental recovery for the miscible
                        floods of 8.5 percent to date. Note that the CO 2 flood is still in operation.<br>
                        Currently, the Viking I pool has been converted from a straight CO 2 injection to a water-
                        alternating-gas scheme (WAG) for further recovery assessment.<br>
                        - <u>Overall Performance</u><br>
                        CO 2 was very effective at mobilizing the oil, and it reduced oil viscosity dramatically. The
                        scheme had a higher-than-anticipated GOR and lower-than-anticipated oil rates and
                        recovery. No containment issues were encountered. All wells had some form of
                        breakthrough. CO 2 mobility in the solvent swept the rock higher than expected; the CO 2
                        travelled through the reservoir readily and moved across the pattern to the second line
                        offset. WAG injection results were promising.<br>
                        - <u>Short- & Long-Term Opportunities</u><br>
                        The greatest potential to increase production rates and recoverable reserves is through
                        WAG injection.<br>
                        Horizontal drilling recovery can be maximized by shortening the period that CO 2 must
                        remain in a specific area (CO 2 utilization efficiency).

                        The Enchant Arcs A & B pool, now called the Commingled 005 pool, is a light-medium oil
                        carbonate reservoir at a depth of 1,355.5 m. The oil gravity is 26.07°API. The average
                        porosity is 0.14, the average water saturation is 0.20 and the initial reservoir pressure is
                        11,905 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 1.743 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The Enchant Arcs A & B pool miscible flood commenced injection of CO 2 on September 23,
                        2004. The pool was switched to water injection on May 9, 2006. Anadarko, the operator at
                        the time of the switch, noticed a reduction in water injection rates, but the production levels
                        were not adjusted. The pool was shut-in after pressure surveys confirmed that the pool
                        pressure was below mandated minimum operating pressure in October. The pool production
                        has remained shut-in, but the injection of water has continued. Ongoing operations are
                        being performed to return the injection rate to initial rates, and the pool pressure is being
                        monitored to determine when the well can be returned to production.<br>
                        As a result of internal confusion during the time of the sale of Anadarko Canada Corporation
                        to Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL), no samples of gas were taken after the pool
                        was returned to water injection, and no sample can be taken until the pool is returned to
                        production.<br>
                        The pool location, wells and recovery performance during the miscible flood scheme are

                        The pool pressure is much lower than the expected value for its depth of 1,400.4 m. The
                        normal pressure gradient is about 10 kPa/m. With this gradient, the initial pressure should
                        be about 14,000 kPa. The reservoir is severely under-pressured. This has important
                        implications. Firstly, the reservoir can be pressured to a much higher pressure. The normal
                        fracture gradient is 18 kPa/m, so the maximum pressure is 25,000 kPa. Secondly, CO 2 may
                        not be miscible with the oil at the original reservoir pressure, but it may become miscible if
                        the reservoir pressure is increased. This seems to be the case in the Chigwell Viking I pool
                        and is probably the case in the Joffre Viking pool as well.<br>

                        The main objectives of the pilot were to demonstrate the technical and economical
                        feasibility of CO 2 EOR in Pembina Cardium; improve productivity and sweep by making use
                        of horizontal producers and existing vertical injectors; improve conformance through an
                        off-trend line drive pattern configuration; develop CO 2 flood operational experience using
                        horizontal wells; identify operational challenges (i.e., wax, GOR control, corrosion); and
                        validate and tune the simulation model (response profile, recycle, recovery, etc.).<br>

                        Rainbow Keg River F pool is a light-medium oil reef carbonate reservoir at a depth of
                        1,785.5 m. The oil gravity is 40°API. The average porosity is 0.08, the average permeability
                        is 771 mD, the average water saturation is 0.19 and the initial reservoir pressure is
                        13,673 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 37.640 x 10 6 m 3 (Husky reported an OOIP of
                        39 x 10 6 m 3 ).<br>
                        Primary production began in April 1966, and it was followed by gas injection in August 1968
                        and waterflood in December 1972. Tertiary immiscible gas flood was started in April 1993,
                        and Tertiary hydrocarbon miscible floods were started in the NW lobe and in the whole pool
                        in April 1996 and April 2000, respectively.<br>
                        - <u>Geologic Description</u><br>
                        The pool is an extensively dolomitized carbonate build-up with four major lobes and a
                        heterogeneous pore system characterized by ten different pore types. Overall, it has
                        excellent horizontal and vertical permeability. The original gas-oil contact was at
                        ~1,310 mSS in all lobes, and the original oil-water contact was at 1,408 mSS, giving ~98 m
                        of oil bank.<br>
                        The EOR project assessment is shown in Table 46. The pool location, wells and recovery
                        performance during the miscible flood scheme are summarized in Figures 118 and 119.<br>
                        A structure map of the Keg River F pool is shown in Figure 120. The production performance
                        of the pool is given in Figure 121 and a prediction of the ultimate oil can be found in
                        Figure 122. A graph of the historical voidage replacement ratio of the pool is given in
                        Figure 123, and the reservoir pressure history of the pool is shown in Figure 124. Finally,
                        plots showing the injected solvent composition can be seen in Figures 125 to 127.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 38 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 15 percent. The remaining OIP was
                        17.691 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        - <u>Current and Future Plans</u>
                        Work-overs were conducted as required, to follow the oil bank down-reef either through
                        deepening or re-completing lower, and to maintain mechanical integrity. The 2008 Work-
                        over were on wells 02/14-28-108-07W6, 00/04-33-108-07W6, and 00/03-05-109-07W6. In 2009, they
                        were conducted on wells 00/14-28-108-07W6 and 00/09-28-108-07W6, and
                        2010 on wells 00/15-05-109-07W6 and 02/14-28-108-07W6.<br>
                        Temperature from the logs of 8 injection wells was recorded in 2009. Infill drilling was
                        continued. The simulation model was to be updated, and development should continue.<br>
                        - <u>Conclusions</u><br>
                        Husky Oil Operations Limited is in compliance with the requirements and conditions stated
                        in Approval No. 10376B for the enhanced recovery of oil by miscible displacement using
                        solvent and chase gas injection in the Rainbow Keg River F pool.<br>
                        Husky Oil Operations Limited has no plans to stop the scheme in the foreseeable future,
                        since it makes good economic use of available gas and NGL products.<br>

                        from pattern 11A was 4.4 percent, and it was 5.6 percent from pattern 9C, for an average
                        of 5.0 percent.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool as a whole was 65 percent.

                        The experimental pilot consisted of a single well sour gas injection scheme which started in
                        September 1995. A total volume of 2,371.2 x 10 3 m 3 was injected into well 9-36-34-21W4M
                        by December 1995. The well was brought on production during February 21 to 25, 1996.
                        Initially, the well flowed at a high GOR. Subsequently, it was put on stable pumping
                        production. During March and April 1996, the well produced a total of 911.7 m 3 of oil,
                        198 x 10 3 m 3 of gas and 5,988 m 3 of water in 1,464 hours, which gives a production
                        capability of 14.95 m 3 /d of oil at a water cut of 86.7 percent and 217 m 3 /m 3 GOR. Prior to
                        the scheme, the well produced at an average rate of 4 m 3 /d of oil at a watercut of
                        98.5 percent and 90 m 3 /m 3 GOR. These results were interpreted to indicate that there was
                        remaining unrecovered attic oil in the pool.<br>
                        The original oil was highly undersaturated. Based on the change in the GOR, the operator
                        estimated that the OOIP in the attic was less than 18,670 m 3 . The estimated primary
                        recovery factor for the pool was 46 percent.

                        optimal CO 2 slug size, well spacing, WAG ratio and injection rates. Operational challenges
                        such as slugging, GOR control, corrosion were identified, and the simulation model was
                        validated and tuned.<br>
                        - <u>2010 Pilot Performance</u>
                        The oil rate improved in four wells. Based on a 2010 pressure survey, Penn West was not
                        compliant with the pressure
                        requirements for Approval 11002A. In Penn West's opinion, the 2010 pressure survey was
                        not representative of average pattern reservoir pressure. Penn West planned to conduct a
                        new bottomhole pressure survey early in 2011 with which to demonstrate pressure and VRR
                        compliance. Penn West was also reviewing current allocation factors (particularly for 16-20-
                        065-10W5), as these values have changed as a result of water injection in wells offsetting
                        the pilot. Approximately 12.5 percent of the hydrocarbon pore volume of CO 2 was injected
                        by the end of 2010.<br>
                        Observed CO 2 concentrations surrounding non-pilot wells were within the historical limit.
                        CO 2 was contained within the pilot area. The target CO 2 injection rate was achieved, and
                        successful isolation to below Zl shale was confirmed; however, injection logging clearly
                        identified that CO 2 was not evenly distributed over the entire target zone.<br>
                        Good pressure response between the injectors and most producers was clearly identified.<br>
                        As of December 2010, oil rate improvement was observed in four wells. Pressure was
                        maintained close to MMP, and miscibility was achieved. The CO 2 was contained within the
                        pilot area and not fully distributed to the target interval. Injector–producer communication
                        was established by monitoring flowing bottomhole pressure.<br>
                        - <u>Compliance</u>
                        CO 2 concentration in the injection stream was greater than or equal to 98 mole percent.
                        Cumulative and monthly VRR was greater than or equal to 1.0, and minimum operating
                        pressure was 18 MPa (in at least two annual pressure surveys).<br>
                        Battery oil, water, gas and CO 2 concentration were continuously monitored, and pilot wells
                        were tested at least once every week. Real time BHP/T sensors were put on the producers,
                        and monthly gas analysis was performed on both pilot and non-pilot wells. Geochemical
                        analysis was also performed, as well as corrosion monitoring and quarterly fluid analysis
                        from each producer.<br>
                        There were no plans to inject CO 2 into the pilot in 2011. Well 2-29 was planned to be
                        converted into an injector. Geochemical, gas analysis monitoring and pressure surveys were
                        continued in 2011.<br>

                        Pennzoil's acid gas injection project is located in Township 116-6W6 in the Zama area of
                        northern Alberta. The project is designed to receive waste acid gas from the Nova Gas
                        Clearinghouse (NCL) gas plant located at 13-12-116-6W6 (Figure 186). The NCL plant
                        processes sour natural gas from the Slave and Sulfur Point formations by removing the H 2 S
                        and C0 2 from the inlet stream and preparing a pipeline-quality sales gas outlet stream for
                        transmission in the Nova pipeline system.<br>
                        The NCL plant started delivering acid gas for disposal on May 3, 1995. The waste product
                        from the NCL plant, acid gas, is delivered to Pennzoil's X2X pool for injection into the Zama
                        Keg River formation using wells 1-25-116-6W6 (the primary injection well) and 2/16-24-
                        116-6W6 (the relief injection well). Voidage in the pool is maintained by production from
                        well 16-24-116-6W6. Well 14-24-116-6W6, also completed in the Keg River X2X pool, is a
                        suspended oil well currently being used to monitor reservoir pressure in the back reef area.
                        The project area is illustrated in Map 1 in Figure 187.<br>
                        -<u>Scheme Performance</u><br>
                        Performance of the scheme is summarized in Figure 189.<br>
                        As of December 31, 1995, cumulative acid gas injected into the X2X pool was 9,600 m 3
                        (28,900 at reservoir conditions). The cumulative amounts of sulfur and CO 2 disposed during
                        this report period are 2,600 tonnes and 14.0103 tonnes, respectively. Wellhead injection
                        pressure averaged 9,000 kPa. An acid gas analysis retrieved during November 1995
                        indicated the acid gas composition is approximately 20 percent H 2 S and 80 percent C0 2 .<br>
                        Cumulative production (as of December 31, 1995) from well 16-24-116~6W6 since acid gas
                        injection started in April 1995 was 270 m 3 of oil, 43,000 m 3 of gas and 55,500 m 3 of water.
                        The cumulative reservoir voidage is 57,100 m 3 .<br>
                        When well 6-24 was first put back on production, it produced a small amount of oil. This oil
                        was not considered tertiary oil, but rather residual waterflood oil not recovered through the
                        previous production completion. The well is currently flowing formation water with a trace of
                        gas.<br>
                        As of December 31, 1995, cumulative net reservoir voidage was 28,200 m 3 . The first
                        representative reservoir pressure of 21,546 kPa was measured at well 16-24 just prior to
                        the scheme start-up. The second representative reservoir pressure of 18,969 kPa was
                        measured in December 1995.<br>
                        Using the voidage-pressure relationship in Figure 190, the average reservoir pressures were
                        predicted for each month during the report period when the reservoir pressure was not
                        measured. Reservoir voidage is a pressure-dependent function, so an iterative solution was
                        required. The formation volume factor for the acid gas, used to convert volumes injected at
                        standard conditions to reservoir volumes, is determined from the relationship presented in
                        Figure 191.<br>
                        The data used to prepare Figure 191 were from the PVT properties for the acid gas.<br>
                        Pennzoil was trying to reduce the reservoir pressure in the X2X pool to the initial reservoir
                        pressure of approximately 15,500 kPa. To achieve that pressure, Pennzoil continued to
                        produce well 16-24 at volumes that exceeded the volumes injected.<br>
                        - <u>Monitoring</u>
                        In November, Pennzoil reviewed the operating procedures for the acid gas injection project
                        with the following conclusions:
                        1. Acid gas composition was determined in only one month of the reporting period. In the
                        future, Pennzoil will perform a tutwieler test on the injection stream every month to
                        determine the H 2 S content. The CO 2 content was determined by subtraction. Pennzoil
                        continued to retrieve an acid gas sample for complete analysis once per reporting period.<br>
                        2. Reservoir pressure was measured in only one month of the reporting period. In the
                        future, Pennzoil will perform a dead weight pressure (DWT) survey on the inactive injection
                        well. From this survey, and knowing the composition of the fluid in the tubing, the reservoir
                        pressure will be determined. In addition to the DWT survey, Pennzoil will conduct a fluid
                        level survey on well 14-24 to determine reservoir pressure in the back reef area every three
                        months, or twice per reporting period.<br>
                        - <u>Corrosion Monitoring</u><br>
                        The initial study prepared for this injection project concluded that the acid gas was only
                        corrosive if free water was present in the system. To ensure the acid gas had a water dew
                        point well below the operating conditions of the injection system, a continuous dew point
                        analyzer was installed in late September 1995. Initially, the analyzer indicated the acid gas
                        had a dew point of -20 to -25°C. After the operating staff made slight modifications to the
                        process, the dew point was lowered to between -30 and -40°C. To supplement the dew
                        point monitoring, an inhibitor was injected continuously into the pipeline. The inhibitor used
                        was a Baker Chemicals product, Cronox, and it was mixed with diesel fuel. X-ray shadow
                        shot surveys were used to monitor the corrosion of the pipeline. A survey completed in
                        November 1995 showed that no corrosion was present in the pipeline.<br>
