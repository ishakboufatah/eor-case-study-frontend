                        The Acheson D3A pool is a light-medium oil carbonate reservoir at a depth of 1,547 m. The oil
                        gravity is 37.8°API.
                        The average porosity is 0.1, the average pay thickness is 18.4 m, the average water saturation
                        is 0.12 and the
                        initial reservoir pressure is 11,922 kPa. The average permeability is 2,870 mD, and the OOIP in
                        the pool was
                        9.692 x 106 m3.<br>
                        The pool location, wells and recovery performance during the miscible flood scheme are

                        This project consists of 5 active producing oil wells, 2 non-active producing oil wells, 2 water
                        disposal injection wells, 78 abandoned wells and 8 suspended oil wells. The current producing
                        rate is approximately
                        20 m3 /d oil and 145 m3 /d water, with an average water cut of 86.2 percent. In the last two
                        years, the GOR has
                        fluctuated between 100 and 140 m3 /m3 . In July 1987, a tertiary hydrocarbon miscible flood
                        scheme was initiated
                        in the northern part of the pool (current Area 2 Township 53 within approval 10003). The
                        miscible flooding was
                        further expanded to the center area of Township 52. The last continuous solvent injection
                        occurred in November 1996.
                        The total solvent injected was 1,034,762 x 103 m3 . Chase gas started in September 1988 in the
                        northern part, which
                        was highly injected (with more than 70 percent of the total gas injected), followed by the
                        southern area in January 1993.
                        The injection of chase gas ended in June 2005. Cumulative gas injection was 1,432,521 x 103 m3.
                        The estimated primary
                        recovery factor for the pool was 54 percent. The incremental EOR recovery factor with the
                        solvent/chase gas injection
                        was 18.5 percent. The remaining OIP is 1.454 x 106 m3 , and possible future incremental recovery
                        is 0.0291 x 106 m3 .<br> - <u>Reservoir Pressure :</u><br>
                        In terms of pressure maintenance, public records do have historical pressure data on some
                        wells in this approval. Public records list the initial pressure of the Acheson D-3A pool when
                        the pool was discovered in 1950 to be 11,922 kPa. The most recent pressure indicates the
                        reservoir pressure was between 10,000 and 12,000 kPa in 1998.<br>
                        This leads to the conclusion that water and solvent injection provided reasonable pressure
                        support. In terms of pressure maintenance, GeoSCOUT records the last static reservoir
                        pressure for this area for two wells on February and June 2010. Well 00/03-02-053-26W4/0
                        had a pressure of 11,101 kPag after 259 hours of shut-in and well 00/14-02-053-26W4/0
                        had a pressure of 9,844 kPag after 332 hours of shut-in. Figure 8 shows a reservoir
                        pressure distribution map as of January, 2011.<br>
                        The future depletion strategy is to maintain production as it is until the producing wells are
                        no longer economic.<br>
                        - <u>Voidage Replacement Ratio (Instantaneous and Cumulative)</u> <br>
                        Calculations were done using PVT data from well 06-23, pressure history, production
                        history, rock properties (porosity and compressibility) and the application of an aquifer
                        function, which Penn West strongly believes is partially supplying energy to the pool (as
                        mentioned in the main application); otherwise, it would be difficult to match the actual data
                        to the simulated data. In the subject area, there are two disposal wells injecting in the D-3A
                        formation which Penn West had considered when balancing the material balance equation
                        regarding fluids injected into the formation. During pressure history matching, some
                        pressure points were below those pressure data in time where the miscible flooding started,
                        and it was quite difficult to get a better match without affecting other variables. As seen in
                        the PVT analysis, the IRP and the bubble point pressure are close enough to deduce that in
                        Part 2 of the pool, some wells could be below the bubble point after production started. The
                        matching in terms of OOIP and production index was adequate.

                        The Ante Creek Beaverhill Lake pool is a light-medium oil carbonate reservoir at a depth of
                        3,433.1 m which was discovered in 1962. The oil gravity is 44°API. The average porosity is
                        0.1, the average permeability is 20 mD, the average water saturation is 0.27 and the initial
                        reservoir pressure is 35,550 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 6.218 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        Solvent flooding was started in 1968, and gas injection began in 1985. The EOR project
                        assessment is shown in Table 2. The pool location, wells and recovery performance during
                        the miscible flood scheme are summarized in Figures 3 and 4.<br>

                        The solvent flood resulted in improved oil recovery, as seen in Figure 4. Following
                        injection, the oil rate remained relatively constant at about 250 m 3 /d, until 1986, at which
                        point the production started to decline. Solvent flooding was completed in 1989, and gas
                        injection ended in 1991.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 16 percent. The remaining OIP is
                        3.855 x 10 6 m 3 .

                        There are six wells in the pool (Figure 5). Production started in 1978, and in 1980, the well
                        13-09-52-08W5 was converted to solvent injection with an injection rate of about
                        300,000 m 3 /d. Water injection into 08-08-52-08W5 was started in 1998, and solvent
                        injection was terminated in 2002. A total of about 450 x 10 6 sm 3 of solvent was injected.
                        The performance of the pool is shown in Figure 6. The oil rate fluctuated between 100 and
                        200 m 3 /d until 1994, when it started declining. The GOR had been rising steadily and by
                        1994 had reached 300 m 3 /m 3 from the original solution GOR of 40 m 3 /m 3 . The GOR peaked
                        at 4,000 m 3 /m 3 and then dropped, presumably as a result of the water injection. Figure 12
                        shows the solvent injection rate and the gas production rate plotted against time. Until
                        1994, the injection rate was significantly above the production rate. The two then tracked
                        each other until the injection rate was reduced and then stopped, when the production rate
                        exceeded the injection rate. In 2004, the gas production rate dropped dramatically. Well 13-
                        09-52-08W5 was later converted to gas production.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 31 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 18 percent. The remaining OIP is
                        0.498 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The composition of the solvent has not been found. Nevertheless, the long period with a
                        near constant GOR and the high recovery argue for miscible conditions to have been
                        achieved.

                        The Bigoray Nisku F pool is a light-medium oil carbonate reservoir at a depth of 2,404 m.
                        The oil gravity is 38.1°API. The average porosity is 0.11, the average permeability is

                        Following injection, the oil rate increased from about 300 m 3 /d in 1987 to about 600 m 3 /d in
                        1993, at which point the production started to decline. This increase in production is likely
                        partially due to the additional well that was brought on during that time period. Solvent
                        flooding was completed in 1989, and gas injection was terminated in 1995.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 40 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 23.5 percent.

                        The Brazeau River Nisku A pool is a light-medium oil carbonate reservoir at a depth of
                        3,110.3 m. The oil gravity is 44.06°API. The average porosity is 0.11, the average
                        permeability is 769 mD, the average water saturation is 0.10 and the initial reservoir
                        pressure is 45,803 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 5.3 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The pool was discovered in 1978 and placed on primary production with three wells. When
                        the reservoir pressure was close to the bubble point of 21,000 kPa in 1980, the pool was
                        converted to a miscible flood. The northernmost and structurally highest well, 05-06-49-
                        12W5M, was converted to injection with perforations close to the top of the formation. The
                        two producing wells, 11-31-48-12W5M and 15-31-48-12W5M, were perforated near the
                        base of the reservoir, about 50 m lower than the perforations in the injector. The gas
                        injection was first used to re-pressure the reservoir to 1,000-1,500 kPa above the minimum
                        miscibility pressure of 34,500 kPa, and then the pressure was kept roughly constant. The oil
                        production rate rose to about 1,200 m 3 /d and was limited mainly by facility constraints.
                        After seven years of injection, gas breakthrough occurred when the gas-oil contact was
                        estimated to be 20 m above the top of the producing perforations. In 1991, a horizontal well
                        was drilled in the reef, and it produced until 2006. Production continued with gas injection
                        until the GOR became excessive in 1994. At that time, gas injection was stopped and the
                        pool was operated in a blow-down mode. By 2012, the oil rate had dropped to about
                        10 m 3 /d with a water cut between 10 and 50 percent and a gas-oil ratio between 3,000 and
                        20,000 m 3 /m 3 .<br>

                        In order to maintain miscibility, the injected gas had to have a composition with an ethane-
                        plus component of over 10 mole percent. The actual injected gas had an ethane-plus
                        component of 12-15 mole percent.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 40.5 percent, though the conversion
                        to a miscible flood occurred when the recovery was only 6 percent of OOIP. The incremental
                        EOR recovery factor with the solvent injection was 26.5 percent, for a total recovery factor
                        of 77 percent. By the end of January, the pool had produced 4,321,439 m 3 of oil and
                        condensate, implying an actual recovery factor of 81.5 percent of OOIP.

                        The Brazeau River Nisku D pool is a light-medium oil carbonate reservoir at a depth of
                        3,069 m. The oil gravity is 42.12°API. The average porosity is 0.065, the average
                        permeability is 50 mD, the average water saturation is 0.12 and the initial reservoir
                        pressure is 34,568 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 2.7 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The pool was discovered in 1978. It was operated in a very similar manner to the Nisku A
                        pool, except that under primary, the pressure dropped to below the bubble point pressure of
                        20,480 kPa from the initial pressure of 34,500 kPa. The miscible flood was implemented and
                        the pressure raised and then kept above the minimum miscibility pressure of 35,000 kPa.
                        Gas breakthrough was much faster than in the Nisku A pool, occurring about six months
                        after the start of injection, when the gas-oil contact was estimated to be 40 m above the
                        top of the producing perforations. The early breakthrough was attributed to the poorer
                        reservoir quality in this pool by Lee, Astete and Jerhoff (1994). A horizontal well was added
                        to the pool in 1993 and was successful in increasing the oil rate and decreasing the gas-oil
                        ratio.<br>

                        The scheme resulted in improved oil recovery, as seen in Figure 15. From the start of gas
                        injection, the oil rate increased from about 200 m 3 /d in 1978 to about 500 m 3 /d by 1989.
                        This increase in production is likely partially due to additional wells coming on production
                        over that time period. Gas injection was completed in 1986, and solvent flooding was
                        terminated in 1997.<br>

                        The Chigwell Viking E pool has been on a CO 2 flooding scheme since 2007. Since the start of

                        early to gauge the full benefits of the CO 2 flooding scheme, but the results are positive thus

                        The pool pressure is much lower than the expected value for its depth of 1,385.6 m. The
                        normal pressure gradient is about 10 kPa/m. With this gradient, the initial pressure should
                        be about 13,800 kPa. Clearly the reservoir is severely under-pressured. This has important
                        implications. Firstly, the reservoir can be pressured to a much higher pressure. The normal
                        fracture gradient is 18 kPa/m, so the maximum pressure is 25,000 kPa. Secondly, CO 2 may
                        not be miscible with the oil at the original reservoir pressure, but it may become miscible if
                        the reservoir pressure is increased. This seems to be the case in the Chigwell Viking I pool

                        The solvent-CO 2 floods resulted in improved oil recovery, as indicated in Figures 21 and 22
                        At the start of ethane injection, the oil rate went from about 20 m 3 /d to 140 m 3 /d. After
                        the
                        start of CO 2 injection, the oil rate went from about 20 m 3 /d to 90 m 3 /d. In both cases, the
                        peak rate was immediately followed by a sharp decline, with a similar decline rate to the
                        earlier primary production (Figure 21).<br>

                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 8 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent-CO 2 injection was 8 percent. The remaining OIP is
                        1.66 x 10 6 m 3 . From the production data, the primary recovery was about 240,000 m 3 , the
                        recovery due to ethane injection was 10,000 m 3 and the recovery due to CO 2 flooding to
                        date was 80,000 m 3 . This implies recovery factors of 7.2 percent for primary, 4.6 percent
                        for ethane and 3.9 percent for CO 2 , for a combined incremental recovery for the miscible
                        floods of 8.5 percent to date. Note that the CO 2 flood is still in operation.<br>
                        Currently, the Viking I pool has been converted from a straight CO 2 injection to a water-
                        alternating-gas scheme (WAG) for further recovery assessment.<br>
                        - <u>Overall Performance</u><br>
                        CO 2 was very effective at mobilizing the oil, and it reduced oil viscosity dramatically. The
                        scheme had a higher-than-anticipated GOR and lower-than-anticipated oil rates and
                        recovery. No containment issues were encountered. All wells had some form of
                        breakthrough. CO 2 mobility in the solvent swept the rock higher than expected; the CO 2
                        travelled through the reservoir readily and moved across the pattern to the second line
                        offset. WAG injection results were promising.<br>
                        - <u>Short- & Long-Term Opportunities</u><br>
                        The greatest potential to increase production rates and recoverable reserves is through
                        WAG injection.<br>
                        Horizontal drilling recovery can be maximized by shortening the period that CO 2 must
                        remain in a specific area (CO 2 utilization efficiency).

                        The Enchant Arcs A & B pool, now called the Commingled 005 pool, is a light-medium oil
                        carbonate reservoir at a depth of 1,355.5 m. The oil gravity is 26.07°API. The average
                        porosity is 0.14, the average water saturation is 0.20 and the initial reservoir pressure is
                        11,905 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 1.743 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The Enchant Arcs A & B pool miscible flood commenced injection of CO 2 on September 23,
                        2004. The pool was switched to water injection on May 9, 2006. Anadarko, the operator at
                        the time of the switch, noticed a reduction in water injection rates, but the production levels
                        were not adjusted. The pool was shut-in after pressure surveys confirmed that the pool
                        pressure was below mandated minimum operating pressure in October. The pool production
                        has remained shut-in, but the injection of water has continued. Ongoing operations are
                        being performed to return the injection rate to initial rates, and the pool pressure is being
                        monitored to determine when the well can be returned to production.<br>
                        As a result of internal confusion during the time of the sale of Anadarko Canada Corporation
                        to Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL), no samples of gas were taken after the pool
                        was returned to water injection, and no sample can be taken until the pool is returned to

                        The scheme resulted in improved oil
                        recovery, as seen in Figure 36. From the start of solvent injection, the oil rate increased
                        from about 500 m 3 /d in 1987 to about 1800 m 3 /d by 1994. This increase in production is
                        likely partially due to additional wells coming on production over that time period. The oil
                        rate began declining rapidly after 1994, and solvent injection was terminated in 2003.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 16 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 7 percent. The remaining OIP was

                        The scheme likely improved oil recovery, as seen in Figure 38. The oil rate in 1990
                        (300 m 3 /d) was similar to the rate in 1994. Solvent flooding was completed in 1992, and

                        The Joffre Viking pool is a light-medium oil sandstone reservoir at a depth of 1,400.4 m.
                        The oil gravity is 38.2°API. The average porosity is 0.13, the average permeability is
                        349.2 mD, the average water saturation is 0.36 and the initial reservoir pressure is
                        6,616 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 8.215 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        Gas injection in the pool commenced in 1988. The EOR project assessment is shown in
                        Table 17. The pool location, wells and recovery performance during the miscible flood
                        scheme are summarized in Figures 46 and 47.<br>
                        The pool pressure is much lower than the expected value for its depth of 1,400.4 m. The
                        normal pressure gradient is about 10 kPa/m. With this gradient, the initial pressure should
                        be about 14,000 kPa. The reservoir is severely under-pressured. This has important
                        implications. Firstly, the reservoir can be pressured to a much higher pressure. The normal
                        fracture gradient is 18 kPa/m, so the maximum pressure is 25,000 kPa. Secondly, CO 2 may
                        not be miscible with the oil at the original reservoir pressure, but it may become miscible if
                        the reservoir pressure is increased. This seems to be the case in the Chigwell Viking I pool
                        and is probably the case in the Joffre Viking pool as well.<br>
                        The Joffre Viking CO 2 miscible flood area is shown in Figure 48, and plots showing historical

                        39 x 10 6 m 3 ).<br>
                        Primary production began in April 1966, and it was followed by gas injection in August 1968
                        and waterflood in December 1972. Tertiary immiscible gas flood was started in April 1993,

                        ~1,310 mSS in all lobes, and the original oil-water contact was at 1,408 mSS, giving ~98 m
                        of oil bank.<br>
                        The EOR project assessment is shown in Table 46. The pool location, wells and recovery
                        performance during the miscible flood scheme are summarized in Figures 118 and 119.<br>
                        A structure map of the Keg River F pool is shown in Figure 120. The production performance
                        of the pool is given in Figure 121 and a prediction of the ultimate oil can be found in
                        Figure 122. A graph of the historical voidage replacement ratio of the pool is given in
                        Figure 123, and the reservoir pressure history of the pool is shown in Figure 124. Finally,
                        plots showing the injected solvent composition can be seen in Figures 125 to 127.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 38 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 15 percent. The remaining OIP was
                        17.691 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        - <u>Current and Future Plans</u>
                        Work-overs were conducted as required, to follow the oil bank down-reef either through
                        deepening or re-completing lower, and to maintain mechanical integrity. The 2008 Work-
                        over were on wells 02/14-28-108-07W6, 00/04-33-108-07W6, and 00/03-05-109-07W6. In 2009, they
                        were conducted on wells 00/14-28-108-07W6 and 00/09-28-108-07W6, and
                        2010 on wells 00/15-05-109-07W6 and 02/14-28-108-07W6.<br>
                        Temperature from the logs of 8 injection wells was recorded in 2009. Infill drilling was
                        continued. The simulation model was to be updated, and development should continue.<br>

                        Husky Oil Operations Limited is in compliance with the requirements and conditions stated
                        in Approval No. 10376B for the enhanced recovery of oil by miscible displacement using
                        solvent and chase gas injection in the Rainbow Keg River F pool.<br>
                        Husky Oil Operations Limited has no plans to stop the scheme in the foreseeable future,
                        since it makes good economic use of available gas and NGL products.<br>
                        The ultimate recoverable oil currently assigned by the ERCB for the tertiary scheme
                        (19,946 x 10 3 m 3 ) is preliminary and attainable.

                        production. During March and April 1996, the well produced a total of 911.7 m 3 of oil,
                        198 x 10 3 m 3 of gas and 5,988 m 3 of water in 1,464 hours, which gives a production
                        capability of 14.95 m 3 /d of oil at a water cut of 86.7 percent and 217 m 3 /m 3 GOR. Prior to
                        the scheme, the well produced at an average rate of 4 m 3 /d of oil at a watercut of
                        98.5 percent and 90 m 3 /m 3 GOR. These results were interpreted to indicate that there was

                        while three of the AWACT wells utilized gas only, five wells had a chemical wetting agent
                        added to the gas treatment program to evaluate its effectiveness in controlling water
                        production. One single well test was conducted utilizing the chemical wetting agent without
                        gas injection to monitor its effect on production rates. The tests have been successful in
                        increasing oil production, reducing water production and extending the production life of
                        several wells.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool as a whole was 1.2 percent.

                        The technical and economical feasibility of CO 2 EOR in SSHU second generation projects (in
                        the non-reef area) was investigated. Well completion strategies were determined, as well as
                        optimal CO 2 slug size, well spacing, WAG ratio and injection rates. Operational challenges
                        such as slugging, GOR control, corrosion were identified, and the simulation model was
                        validated and tuned.<br>
                        - <u>2010 Pilot Performance</u>
                        The oil rate improved in four wells. Based on a 2010 pressure survey, Penn West was not
                        compliant with the pressure
                        requirements for Approval 11002A. In Penn West's opinion, the 2010 pressure survey was
                        not representative of average pattern reservoir pressure. Penn West planned to conduct a
                        new bottomhole pressure survey early in 2011 with which to demonstrate pressure and VRR
                        compliance. Penn West was also reviewing current allocation factors (particularly for 16-20-
                        065-10W5), as these values have changed as a result of water injection in wells offsetting
                        the pilot. Approximately 12.5 percent of the hydrocarbon pore volume of CO 2 was injected
                        by the end of 2010.<br>
                        Observed CO 2 concentrations surrounding non-pilot wells were within the historical limit.
                        CO 2 was contained within the pilot area. The target CO 2 injection rate was achieved, and
                        successful isolation to below Zl shale was confirmed; however, injection logging clearly
                        identified that CO 2 was not evenly distributed over the entire target zone.<br>
                        Good pressure response between the injectors and most producers was clearly identified.<br>
                        As of December 2010, oil rate improvement was observed in four wells. Pressure was
                        maintained close to MMP, and miscibility was achieved. The CO 2 was contained within the
                        pilot area and not fully distributed to the target interval. Injector–producer communication
                        was established by monitoring flowing bottomhole pressure.<br>
                        - <u>Compliance</u>
                        CO 2 concentration in the injection stream was greater than or equal to 98 mole percent.
                        Cumulative and monthly VRR was greater than or equal to 1.0, and minimum operating
                        pressure was 18 MPa (in at least two annual pressure surveys).<br>
                        Battery oil, water, gas and CO 2 concentration were continuously monitored, and pilot wells
                        were tested at least once every week. Real time BHP/T sensors were put on the producers,
                        and monthly gas analysis was performed on both pilot and non-pilot wells. Geochemical
                        analysis was also performed, as well as corrosion monitoring and quarterly fluid analysis
                        from each producer.<br>
                        There were no plans to inject CO 2 into the pilot in 2011. Well 2-29 was planned to be
                        converted into an injector. Geochemical, gas analysis monitoring and pressure surveys were
                        continued in 2011.<br>

                        1,479.9 m. The oil gravity is 36.09°API. The average porosity is 0.075, the average
                        permeability is 2,994.26 mD, the average water saturation is 0.16 and the initial reservoir
                        pressure is 12,536 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 0.538 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The EOR project assessment is shown in Table 71. The pool location, wells and recovery
                        performance during the miscible flood scheme are summarized in Figures 184 and 185.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 27.5 percent.<br>
                        Pennzoil's acid gas injection project is located in Township 116-6W6 in the Zama area of
                        northern Alberta. The project is designed to receive waste acid gas from the Nova Gas
                        Clearinghouse (NCL) gas plant located at 13-12-116-6W6 (Figure 186). The NCL plant
                        processes sour natural gas from the Slave and Sulfur Point formations by removing the H 2 S
                        and C0 2 from the inlet stream and preparing a pipeline-quality sales gas outlet stream for
                        transmission in the Nova pipeline system.<br>
                        The NCL plant started delivering acid gas for disposal on May 3, 1995. The waste product
                        from the NCL plant, acid gas, is delivered to Pennzoil's X2X pool for injection into the Zama
                        Keg River formation using wells 1-25-116-6W6 (the primary injection well) and 2/16-24-
                        116-6W6 (the relief injection well). Voidage in the pool is maintained by production from
                        well 16-24-116-6W6. Well 14-24-116-6W6, also completed in the Keg River X2X pool, is a
                        suspended oil well currently being used to monitor reservoir pressure in the back reef area.
                        The project area is illustrated in Map 1 in Figure 187.<br>
                        The NCL plant generates approximately 60 x 10 3 m 3 /d of acid gas at current throughput
levels. Daily activities are summarized graphically in Figure 188. The acid gas stream is
averaging approximately 20 percent H 2 S and 80 percent C0 2 . Approval 7732 originally
allowed 70,000 m 3 /d of injection. Pennzoil, at the request of NCL, has applied for and
received approval to increase the injection to 120,000 m 3 /d.<br>
                        -<u>Scheme Performance</u><br>
                        Performance of the scheme is summarized in Figure 189.<br>
                        As of December 31, 1995, cumulative acid gas injected into the X2X pool was 9,600 m 3
                        (28,900 at reservoir conditions). The cumulative amounts of sulfur and CO 2 disposed during
                        this report period are 2,600 tonnes and 14.0103 tonnes, respectively. Wellhead injection
                        pressure averaged 9,000 kPa. An acid gas analysis retrieved during November 1995
                        indicated the acid gas composition is approximately 20 percent H 2 S and 80 percent C0 2 .<br>
                        Cumulative production (as of December 31, 1995) from well 16-24-116~6W6 since acid gas
                        injection started in April 1995 was 270 m 3 of oil, 43,000 m 3 of gas and 55,500 m 3 of water.
                        The cumulative reservoir voidage is 57,100 m 3 .<br>
                        When well 6-24 was first put back on production, it produced a small amount of oil. This oil
                        was not considered tertiary oil, but rather residual waterflood oil not recovered through the
                        previous production completion. The well is currently flowing formation water with a trace of
                        gas.<br>
                        As of December 31, 1995, cumulative net reservoir voidage was 28,200 m 3 . The first
                        representative reservoir pressure of 21,546 kPa was measured at well 16-24 just prior to
                        the scheme start-up. The second representative reservoir pressure of 18,969 kPa was
                        measured in December 1995.<br>
                        Using the voidage-pressure relationship in Figure 190, the average reservoir pressures were
                        predicted for each month during the report period when the reservoir pressure was not
                        measured. Reservoir voidage is a pressure-dependent function, so an iterative solution was
                        required. The formation volume factor for the acid gas, used to convert volumes injected at
                        standard conditions to reservoir volumes, is determined from the relationship presented in
                        Figure 191.<br>
                        The data used to prepare Figure 191 were from the PVT properties for the acid gas.<br>
                        Pennzoil was trying to reduce the reservoir pressure in the X2X pool to the initial reservoir
                        pressure of approximately 15,500 kPa. To achieve that pressure, Pennzoil continued to
                        produce well 16-24 at volumes that exceeded the volumes injected.<br>
                        - <u>Monitoring</u>
                        In November, Pennzoil reviewed the operating procedures for the acid gas injection project
                        with the following conclusions:
                        1. Acid gas composition was determined in only one month of the reporting period. In the
                        future, Pennzoil will perform a tutwieler test on the injection stream every month to
                        determine the H 2 S content. The CO 2 content was determined by subtraction. Pennzoil
                        continued to retrieve an acid gas sample for complete analysis once per reporting period.<br>
                        2. Reservoir pressure was measured in only one month of the reporting period. In the
                        future, Pennzoil will perform a dead weight pressure (DWT) survey on the inactive injection
                        well. From this survey, and knowing the composition of the fluid in the tubing, the reservoir
                        pressure will be determined. In addition to the DWT survey, Pennzoil will conduct a fluid
                        level survey on well 14-24 to determine reservoir pressure in the back reef area every three
                        months, or twice per reporting period.<br>
                        - <u>Corrosion Monitoring</u><br>
                        The initial study prepared for this injection project concluded that the acid gas was only
                        corrosive if free water was present in the system. To ensure the acid gas had a water dew
                        point well below the operating conditions of the injection system, a continuous dew point
                        analyzer was installed in late September 1995. Initially, the analyzer indicated the acid gas
                        had a dew point of -20 to -25°C. After the operating staff made slight modifications to the
                        process, the dew point was lowered to between -30 and -40°C. To supplement the dew
                        point monitoring, an inhibitor was injected continuously into the pipeline. The inhibitor used
                        was a Baker Chemicals product, Cronox, and it was mixed with diesel fuel. X-ray shadow
                        shot surveys were used to monitor the corrosion of the pipeline. A survey completed in
                        November 1995 showed that no corrosion was present in the pipeline.<br>

                        The Zama Muskeg L pool is a light-medium oil evaporite reservoir at a depth of 1,512.8 m.
                        The oil gravity is 36.09°API. The average porosity is 0.1, the average permeability is
                        2,232.49 mD, the average water saturation is 0.16 and the initial reservoir pressure is
                        13,885 kPa. The OOIP in the pool was 0.429 x 10 6 m 3 .<br>
                        The EOR project assessment is shown in Table 72. The pool location, wells and recovery
                        performance during the miscible flood scheme are summarized in Figures 192 and 193.<br>
                        The estimated primary recovery factor for the pool was 20 percent. The incremental EOR
                        recovery factor with the solvent injection was 5 percent.

                    <li><strong>Slaughter Estate Unit</strong><br>
                        This miscible flood pilot is in the West Texas San Andres dolomite and is an
                        example of a gas flood with very good oil recovery. The permeability is low
                        averaging around 4 mD at a depth of about 5000 ft. Good recovery was
                        obtained in a waterflood in the early 1970s prior to gas flooding.<br>
                        The gas injected contained 72 mol% CO 2 and 28 mol% H 2 S. The MMP
                        of approximately 1000 psia with this gas and moderate API oil (32 API) is
                        substantially less than the average reservoir pressure of 2000 psia. Thus, this
                        flood is MCM. The acid gas was eventually replaced with a chase gas
                        consisting of mostly nitrogen and then water. Water was injected alternately
                        with the acid gas with a WAG ratio of about 1.0. A 25% hydrocarbon pore
                        volume (HCPV) slug of acid gas was injected. The chase gas was also alter-
                        nated with water, and eventually the gas water ratio was reduced to 0.7 to
                        improve vertical sweep.<br>
                        The cycles shown in Figure 2.1 for the chase gas correspond to the cycles
                        in WAG injection. During WAG, water injectivity losses of about 50% were
                        experienced owing to trapping of gas as water is injected. Furthermore, there
                        is evidence of gas channeling as the GOR began to climb at the same time
                        or just prior to the oil production.<br>

                        ncremental tertiary recovery was 19.6% OOIP, which is largely the
                        result of good WAG management and the use of H 2 S in the gas (Stein et al.,
                        1992). H 2 S, although very dangerous, is a very good miscible agent. When
                        added to the primary and secondary recovery (waterflood) of about 50%, the
                        total recovery in this pilot is expected to be around 70% OOIP, which is
                        well above the average for most fields. Because of the great success of the
                        pilot, the unit was gas flooded field wide. The field-wide flood has also been
                        successful although a higher gas water ratio was used.<br>

                        Discovered in 1951, the West Sussex Shannon reservoir is
                        located in Wyoming, USA. Full-scale waterflooding began in 1959. The cumulative
                        recovery from primary and secondary operations was 18.1 and 24.1%, respectively.<br>
                        Conoco conducted a CO 2 pilot in a previously waterflooded portion of the field.
                        Covering 9.6 acres, the waterflood was a diagonal half of an inverted five-spot (one
                        injector and three producers). Though a pilot test, the well spacing was 9.6 acres and
                        representative of field-scale spacing. Continuous CO 2 injection started in December
                        1982. The pre-flood oil cut was 1%; the peak oil cut was 21%. The ultimate cumulative
                        tertiary recovery was 9.5%..<br>
